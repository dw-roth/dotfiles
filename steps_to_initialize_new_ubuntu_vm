root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# ufw allow 22/tcp 
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# ufw enable

[3. Add fail2ban to track unauthorized login attempts]
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# apt install fail2ban    [ track unauthorized login attempts]

[4. Add new non-root user with root capabilities. In the case, user is 'dwroth' ]
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# adduser dwroth 
[ when prompted, give user password as you'll need for sudo elevations ]
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# usermod -aG sudo dwroth 
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# su dwroth 
dwroth@dwroth-ubuntu:/root$ cd                [ get to new user home folder]
dwroth@dwroth-ubuntu:~$ mkdir .ssh && cd $_
dwroth@dwroth-ubuntu:~$ 

[4a. copy public ssh key to authorized_keys file]
dwroth@dwroth-ubuntu:~$ echo [paste public ssh key to command line] > authorized_keys
dwroth@dwroth-ubuntu:~$ cat authorized_keys   [ ensure key if properly in file ]
dwroth@dwroth-ubuntu:~$ exit                  [ drop back to root]

[5. change login/auth rules]
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
> [set PermitRootLogin to no]
> [uncomment PubkeyAuthentication and ensure set to yes]

[ 6. restart ssh deamon, exit, and reconnect with new user]
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# systemctl restart ssh 
root@dwroth-ubuntu:~# exit
